## Improvement Roadmap

### **üìã User Feedback Analysis**
**Overall Rating: 8.5/10** - Highly effective for codebase research with specific areas for enhancement

**‚úÖ Current Strengths:**
- Excellent at finding specific functions and implementations
- Good relationship mapping between related modules  
- Effective pattern matching for context-related code

**‚ö†Ô∏è Identified Limitations:**
1. **Too many unrelated database models** in search results
2. **Graph relationships sometimes include low-relevance connections**
3. **Requires multiple queries** to get complete picture of complex topics

### **üöÄ Planned Enhancements**

#### **1. Enhanced Relevance Filtering**
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Smart detection and filtering of database models, schemas, and configuration files when not relevant to query context
- **File Type Scoring**: Implement scoring system that prioritizes source code files over configuration/data files based on query intent
- **Semantic Relevance Threshold**: Add configurable thresholds to filter out results below certain similarity scores to reduce noise

#### **2. Improved Graph Relationship Scoring**
- **Context-Aware Relationship Weighting**: Weight relationships based on semantic similarity between connected files, not just structural connections
- **Relationship Decay**: Implement decay function for multi-hop relationships to prevent distant, irrelevant connections from dominating results
- **Smart Relationship Filtering**: Filter out common but low-value relationships (e.g., basic utility imports, common framework calls)

#### **3. Query Expansion and Context Building**
- **Automatic Follow-up Queries**: When initial results are sparse or incomplete, automatically expand search with semantically related terms
- **Result Clustering**: Group related results together to provide comprehensive topic coverage in single response
- **Context Summarization**: Add brief explanations of how results relate to each other and to the original query

#### **4. Implementation Targets**

**File: `mcp_server.py` Enhancements:**
- Add `RelevanceFilter` class for intelligent content filtering
- Enhance `RelationshipScoring` with context-aware weights and decay functions
- Implement query expansion logic in `hybrid_search` method

- **Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence metrics for each result's relevance
- **Context Bridging**: Automatically find and include missing context between results

### **üéØ Expected Outcomes**
- **Reduced Noise**: Significant reduction in irrelevant database models and low-value relationships
- **Higher Precision**: More targeted results with better contextual relevance
- **Improved User Experience**: Single queries provide more complete and coherent information
- **Enhanced Relevance Ranking**: Results ordered by actual usefulness rather than just structural/semantic similarity

### **üìä Success Metrics**
- Target overall rating improvement from 8.5/10 to 9.5/10
- Reduce false positive rate for database model inclusion by 70%
- Increase query completion rate (single query provides complete context) by 60%
- Maintain or improve current strengths while addressing identified limitations
